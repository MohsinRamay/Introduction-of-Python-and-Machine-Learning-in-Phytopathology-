# Introduction-of-Python-and-Machine-Learning-in-Phytopathology-
Python is a powerful open-source programming language known for its easy-access libraries and framework built for machine learning modeling tasks. With the advancements in plant phenotyping technologies in the past few years, the application of machine learning models in phytopathology for plant disease symptom detection and severity estimation has gained increasing interest. This proposed workshop aims to introduce python language and its environment to plant pathologists and hands-on activities on data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. In addition, this workshop will also introduce machine learning packages and techniques for conducting classification modeling work using datasets from published phytopathological research. This workshop aims to assist plant pathologists in the initial learning curve of a new programming language and motivate them to explore and use python to excel in their research.
